# Artemis

A game engine for "choose your adventure" type stories

# Synopsis

I've always wanted to make a game with WordPress; Not sure why but the idea has amused me for a long time.
Welp, my dreams are coming true! I figured that WordPress will be handling the front end while I can still
code any needed features in the backend. Most of this repo is the latter, a backend REST API that the
included WP plugin talks to.
